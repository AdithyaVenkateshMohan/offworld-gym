Getting Access
==============

The main purpose of OffWorld Gym is to provide you with easy access to a physical robotic environment and allow you to train and test your algorithms on a real robotic system. To get access to the real robot, head to our web portal `gym.offworld.ai <https://gym.offworld.ai>`_ and do the following:

  * Register as a user at `gym.offworld.ai <https://gym.offworld.ai>`_
  * `Book your experiment <https://gym.offworld.ai/book>`_ using the OffWorld Gym resource management system
  * Once you install the ``offworld_gym`` library, copy "OffWorld Gym Access Token" from your `Profile  <https://gym.offworld.ai/account>`_ page and add ``export OFFWORLD_GYM_ACCESS_TOKEN=paste_your_token_here`` to your ``~/.bashrc`` script.
  * Install the ``offworld_gym`` library. Please follow the instructions in the `Installation <./installation.html>`_ section of this documentation.

The setup is complete! Now you can

  * Read about our mission in the `About <https://gym.offworld.ai/about>`_ section
  * Browse the documentation at `gym.offworld.ai/docs <https://gym.offworld.ai/docs>`_
  * Have a look at the `examples <./examples.html>`_.
  * See the `Leaderboard <https://gym.offworld.ai/leaderboard>`_, can your algorithm do better?
  * Run your experiments and monitor their performance under `My Experiments <https://gym.offworld.ai/myexperiments>`_
